# UI-UX

These are the assignments completed during my UI/UX Designer Course with The Tech Academy. Most websites have a screenshot of the mockup which can be found at [dribbble.com/haydenstark](https://dribbble.com/haydenstark)

## Canyon Hikers
Goal of this assignment was to create a new website for the company "Canyon Hikers". Their primary goal was to represent the picturesque beauty of the the Grand Canyon and simultaneousy sell the user on finding out more information and potentially booking a trip. Upon completing the website, I was then asked to perform usability testing to ensure the site was intuitive and user-friendly.

## Em's Outlook
This assignment was to practice creating a mockup and transferring that mockup into code, while trying to keep the images as the focal point of the site and the layout responsive.

## Kitten
A very straight-forward assignment that asked for the site be styled with a sense of maturity and a consistent color palette.

## Red Panda
This assignment had multiple items to check off including being focused on one species of animal, a video about that species, a contact form, an about section, a portion that included animation, incorporating an audio file into the website, a creative header font, and a distintive color palette.

## Responsive
The purpose of this assignment was to practice creating a completely responsive layout and to manipulate the horizontal and vertical breakpoints. I decided to create an art exhibit poster so the focus was when and where the breakpoints occurred.

## Untensil
This assignment was to practice creating a wire-frame, mockup, and then code a one page website. I centered the assignment around an imagined up and coming brand "Un-tensil", which sells cutlery "like you've never seen".

## XD
This folder contains two prototyping projects completed with Adobe XD - "Hun-ee" and "Pawse". Both had requirements of utilizing the different features of XD including menu overlays, incorporating audio, user interaction and associated animation, and responsive layout design.

## animations
An extremely simple html, but for the purpose of practicing using CSS animation libraries.

## fonts
One of the first assignments in the course - was meant to demonstrate how different typefaces can inspire different emotions.
